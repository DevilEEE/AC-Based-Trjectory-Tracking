# AC-Based-Trjectory-Tracking
A implentation of trajectory tracking based on Actor-Critic algorithm:    
Environment(all you need):     
System: Windows     
IDE: Spyder(python3.5) Matlab(R2017b)     
Packages:     
For matlab:     
1.GPOPS: we use this package with matlab to get the reference trajectory.    
For python:     
1.pytroch: we use this to handle the Actor-Critic.      
2.numpy also some other packages.       
You my see the result package for the final result, there are some pictures.
